LITERATURE STUDY (OR BACKGROUND)
The data science lifecycle consists of five core stages or activities, namely:
•	Defining the problem and refining the questions
•	Exploring the data
•	Building models (i.e., machine learning models)
•	Evaluate the models and interpret the results
•	Communicating the results and deploying the model to production
The above steps are iterative until the desired results are achieved. This assignment focuses on the last step which is to communicate the results and deploy the models and visualizations. The purpose of the activity is to enable information sharing and collaboration between stakeholders. Co

Although the models were built and successfully evaluated on local machines, they become more useful when deployed (i.e., in production environments) and integrated into other business processes. There are several frameworks that can be used to deploy machine learning models. The most popular deployment frameworks are Flask, Django and Streamlit. These frameworks are chosen based on the use case, type of data, functional and non-functional requirements provided by these frameworks. Flask is an open-source utility framework that is based on Python, for building web applications, specifically for data science and machine learning projects. Flask can be challenging in managing the development environment as compared to Streamlit. Streamlit is also a free open-source framework for Python that is user-friendly. It is effective and efficient in building data and model applications and enables sharing and collaboration. Django is a high-level Python web development framework that is mainly used for high-level development for clean design (i.e., easy to implement the MVP framework). Although Flask and Django are mainly used by most companies on enterprise level, they are complex and not easy to configure and implement. 
Due to the nature of this project, type of data and the use case, the Streamlit was the best option to implement because of its user-friendliness, cost effectiveness, ease of use and ease of environment effectively and efficiently. Since the solution on this assignment is implemented using Python, the Streamlit has been the best option considered after conducting different resources from literature.
